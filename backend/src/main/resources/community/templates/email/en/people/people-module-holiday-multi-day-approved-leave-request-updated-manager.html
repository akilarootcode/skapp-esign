    <p>
        The {{leaveType}} leave request for {{employeeName}} from {{leaveStartDate}}
        to {{leaveEndDate}} has been updated, as {{organizationName}} has declared
        {{holidayDate}} a company holiday ({{holidayName}}).
    </p>

    <p>
        The revised duration of the leave request is now {{revisedDuration}} days.
