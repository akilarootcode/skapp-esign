<div>
    <p>
        Your {{leaveType}} leave request from {{leaveStartDate}} to {{leaveEndDate}}
        has been updated, as {{organizationName}} has declared {{holidayDate}} a
        company holiday ({{holidayName}}).
    </p>

    <p>
        Your leave balance will be updated accordingly. The revised duration of your
        leave request is now {{revisedDuration}} days.
